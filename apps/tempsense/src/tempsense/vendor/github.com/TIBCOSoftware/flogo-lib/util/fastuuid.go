// Package fastuuid provides fast UUID generation of 192 bit
// universally unique identifiers. It does not provide
// formatting or parsing of the identifiers (it is assumed
// that a simple hexadecimal or base64 representation
// is sufficient, for which adequate functionality exists elsewhere).
//
// Note that the generated UUIDs are not unguessable - each
// UUID generated from a Generator is adjacent to the
// previously generated UUID.
//
// It ignores RFC 4122.
//
// fm: Modified to return 128 bit UUID as string
